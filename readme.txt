Run this with the command "python3 main.py" while in the working directory of the folder it's in. Also, do NOT delete any files it makes while it's working, those are very important, and if you delete one, it could ruin the whole program's progress and you'll have to run it all over again, losing all the progress it's done and wasting your time. It's meant to delete the files after it's done working, if it doesn't do this, tell me. And do not delete model.txt, it stores the whole neural network, if you delete it, the program will not work.
